In Silico Characterization of Defense System Hotspots in Acinetobacter spp.

These findings provide critical insights into the genetic organization of phage defense systems, contributing to a broader understanding of bacterial immunity and the evolutionary dynamics that shape Acinetobacter genomes. This knowledge lays the foundation for developing targeted interventions for combating antibiotic resistance A. baumannii.
